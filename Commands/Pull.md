# Git Pull

Similar to a [Git Push](./Push.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repository.

Only this time it will **Pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local repository.

This means any commits made that on the remote repository will be pulled down and added to local repository.

This can be done by addding the remote name branch name: 

```
git pull origin main
```

If there is any upstream you can use `git pull` without specifying a remote or branch.
